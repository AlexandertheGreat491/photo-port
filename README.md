## Description

A single page portfolio site for a photographer.

- What was your motivation?
My motivation for creating this application was to build a portfolio for a photographer that can be edited and updated without affecting parts of the page.

- What did you learn?
I learned how to create components and tests utilizing React to create a single page application that utilizes custom CSS and Bootstrap for styling.

## Installation

To install this application please navigate to the directory where you want to save this project and begin by running the `git clone` command followed by (https://github.com/AlexandertheGreat491/photo-port.git) to clone the code to your local computer.

Once the code is cloned to your local computer please use these commands to get the app running:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Usage

Please view this screenshot to get an idea for how the app is utilized.
